# Awesome Rules [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This collection focuses on rules written in standard markdown format with YAML frontmatter, compatible with various AI coding assistants like Cursor, Continue.dev, and others following the [amplified.dev](https://amplified.dev/) standard.

## Why Rules?

Rules are more than just suggestions; they’re essential building blocks that shape how your assistant interprets your requests. Clear, actionable rules help the agent consistently produce code that meets your standards, avoids common pitfalls, and aligns with your team’s workflows.

## Using Rules Locally

### [`rules` CLI](https://rules.so)

The `rules` CLI helps you fetch and manage rules locally, across any AI coding assistant.

### Install `rules`

The `rules` CLI can be installed using NPM:

```bash
npm i -g rules-cli
```

### Adding Rules to Your Project

To download rules to your repository you can use `rules add`. For example:

```bash
rules add starter/nextjs-rules
```

This will add them to your project in a local `.rules` folder.

You can also download from GitHub rather than the rules registry:

```bash
rules add gh:continuedev/rules
```

From there you can use `rules render` to translate into the format of your choice:

**For Cursor:**
```bash
rules render cursor
```

will create the following folder structure:

```
your-project/
├── .cursor/
    └── rules/
        ├── coding-standards.mdc
        ├── testing-guidelines.mdc
        └── documentation-rules.mdc
```

**For Continue:**
```bash
rules render continue
```

will create the following folder structure:

```
your-project/
├── .continue/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── coding-standards.md
│       ├── testing-guidelines.md
│       └── documentation-rules.md
```

**For other AI assistants:**
See [the docs](https://www.rules.so/#render-rules) for the full list of supported formats.

## Contributing
